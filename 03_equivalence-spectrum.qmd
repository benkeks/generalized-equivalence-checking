$$\semanticsobs{p} ≔ \set{φ ∈ \hml \mid p ∈ \semantics{φ}}$$

#### Observable Difference

The difference between $p$ and $q$ is defined as:
$$\difference{p}{q} ≔ \semanticsobs{p} \setminus \semanticsobs{q}.$$

### Behavioral preorder and equivalence

Rephrasing @def-distinctions, two states are preordered with respect to a sublogic $\observationsvar{} ⊆ \hml$
$$p \bpreordvar{\observationsvar{}} q ⟺ \difference{p}{q} \cap \observationsvar{} = \varnothing.$$

### Understanding the Equivalence Hierarchy Through Modal Logics

Let us revisit the hierarchy between bisimilarity, similarity, and trace equivalence of Subsection [-@sec-hierarchy-equivalences].
So far, we have only looked into the characterization of bisimilarity through the whole of $\hml$ in @lem-hennessy-milner.
But there is merit in also characterizing other equivalences through sublogics $\observationsvar{} \subseteq \hml$.

The first big advantage of modal characterizations is that they lead to proper preorders and equivalences *by design* due to @prp-hml-eq.
That is, if a behavioral preorder (or equivalence) is defined through modal logics, there is no need of proving transitivity and reflexivity (and symmetry).

The second big advantage of modal characterizations is that they can, if defined cleverly, directly unveil the hierarchy between preorders because of the following property.

::: {#prp-difference-contraposition}

If $\observationsvar{} \subseteq \observationsvar{}'$ then $p \bpreordvar{\observationsvar{}'} q$ implies $p \bpreordvar{\observationsvar{}} q$ for all $p,q$.

:::



<!-- That the relational characterization of bisimilarity and the modal characterization of @def-bisimilarity coincide, is due to @hm1980hml.
It makes sense to consider the $\hml$ characterization as primary.
Van Glabbeek [-@glabbeek2001ltbtsiReport;-@glabbeek1993ltbt] shows how all the other common equivalences can be understood to be a lattice of sublanguages of $\hml$. -->

### Observability Lattice

::: {#def-spectrum}
#### Equivalence Spectra

An *equivalence spectrum* $(\notions, \leq, \observationsvar{N \in \notions})$ consists of

- a set of notions of observability $\notions$,
- a partial order $\leq \; \subseteq \notions \times \notions$, and
- corresponding observations $\observationsvar{} \, \colon \notions \to \powerset{\hml}$.

For any two notions $N,M \in \notions$, $N \leq M$ implies $\observationsvar{N} \subseteq \observationsvar{M}$.

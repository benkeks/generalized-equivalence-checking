{{< include style/macros.md >}}

Have you ever looked at two program descriptions and wondered *how equivalent they are*
---or, conversely: how they can be distinguished?

I have run into this problem often, for instance when analyzing models of distributed algorithms or when devising examples for teaching.
But obviously, the question already occurs every time one rewrites a program part and hopes for it to still do its job.

The linear-time–branching-time spectrum with silent moves as depicted in @glabbeek1993ltbt.
:::

The first time I had to formally face the question was when working as a student research assistant:
I was tasked with implementing a translation from the process algebra Timed CSP to Timed Automata.^[
    The aim was to bridge between the tools FDR2 and UPPAAL for Göthel's dissertation [-@goethel12mechanicalVerificationRTS].
    The previous work I was to base the translations on had serious flaws:
    One approach introduced spurious deadlocks to the model, the other was unable to handle nesting of choices and parallel composition.
    Clearly, we had to change the encoding!]
… How to tell whether the translation would properly honor the semantics of the two formalisms?
Did it translate CSP terms to automata *with the same meaning*?
Even the definition of the question is tricky, as there are different notions of what counts as “same meaning” in the semantics of programs.

I then took my very first look into the seminal paper on the landscape of process equivalences with internal behavior, the “Linear-time–branching-time spectrum II” by van Glabbeek [-@glabbeek1993ltbt].
Its central figure, reproduced in @fig-ltbts2-paper, mesmerized me.
But, how to use the spectrum to decide for a given pair of processes which of the many equivalences apply, is far from straightforward.
Over the years, I have learned that others too have run into this problem:
For instance, @nestmann1996decoding thinking about process algebra encodings and @bell2013certifiably verifying compiler optimizations.
The problem can be summarized as follows:

> How does one conveniently decide for a pair of systems which notions from a spectrum of behavioral equivalences equate the two?

Above question will be the *research question of this thesis*.
We^[
    As you might have noticed, this text uses more personal pronouns than is common in much of computer science literature.
    Their meaning is the same as in a lecture:
    “I” = “The author”; “You” = “The audience”; “We” = “The asynchronous collective of author and readers,” or sometimes “The author together with coauthors.”
] want to enable future researchers to tap into the wisdom of the linear-time–branching-time spectrum and to easily determine what equivalences fit their models.

:::

Van Glabbeek's papers on comparative concurrency semantics [-@glabbeek1990ltbt1;-@glabbeek1993ltbt] treat a zoo of distinct *qualitative questions* of the form “Are processes $p$ and $q$ equivalent with respect to notion $N$?”, where $N$ would for example be trace or bisimulation equivalence.
For many of the equivalences, there are various algorithms and implementations to decide whether processes are equal.

But van Glabbeek unveils an underlying structure where the equivalences can easily be compared with respect to their distinctive power.
This is analogous to the *spectrum of light* where seemingly qualitative properties (“The light is blue / green / red.”) happen to be *quantitative* (“The distribution of wavelengths peaks at $460 / 550 / 630~\mathrm{nm}$.”).

For light (i.e. electromagnetic radiation), the mix of wavelengths can be determined through a process called *spectroscopy*.
So, we may ask:

::: {#nte-idea-spectroscopy .callout-idea .callout-note}
#### Spectroscopy?

If there exists a “linear-time–branching time spectrum,” does this mean, there also is some kind of “linear-time–branching-time *spectroscopy*”?
:::

This thesis answers the question positively, which is the key step to tackle our research question.
One can compute what mix of (in-)distinguishabilities exists between a pair of processes,
and this places the two on the spectrum of equivalences.
We thus turn a set of qualitative equivalence problems into one quantitative problem of *how equivalent* two systems are.
As we will see, this amounts to an abstract form of subtraction between programs, determining what kinds of differences an outside examiner might observe.
Thereby *one* algorithm works for *all* of a spectrum.

## This Thesis

The algorithm at the core of this thesis describes how to *decide all behavioral equivalences at once* for varying spectra of equivalence using *games that can count* to *limit possible distinctions by attacker energy levels*.
More precisely, we make the following contributions:

- @sec-preliminaries lays some foundations and makes precise *how bisimilarity games relate to grammars of distinguishing formulas* of Hennessy–Milner modal logic. 
- @sec-spectrum shows *how to understand the strong linear-time--branching-time spectrum quantitatively* and formalizes the *spectroscopy problem*.
- @sec-approach introduces the approach of *characterizing equivalence spectra through a class of energy games* and *how to decide such games*.
- @sec-strong-spectrum applies the approach to decide the whole strong spectrum through one *game for linear-time--branching-time spectroscopy*.
- TODO @sec-weak-spectrum dicusses case studies with internal behavior and recharts the *weak spectrum of equivalences accounting for silent steps* to fit our game approach.
- TODO @sec-silent-step-spectroscopy adapts the game for the *weak spectrum of equivalences*.
- TODO @sec-implementations showcases implementations to conveniently perform equivalence spectroscopies in web browsers and using GPU parallelization.

## Energy Games

### General Energy Games

To introduce energy games, we generalize the definitions on games (@def-game and the following) to include *energy levels*.

::: {#def-energy-game}
#### Energy Reachability Game

Given a partially ordered set of energies $(\abstractenergies, \leq)$, an *energy reachability game* $\game^üó≤$ is a reachability game $(G, G_\defender, \gamemoveblank)$ extended by an edge labeling of energy updates $\abstractupdate \colon (\gamemoveblank) \to (\abstractenergies \to (\set{‚ä•} \cup \abstractenergies))$.

We denote by $\game^üó≤(g_0, e_0)$ the game played from starting position $g_0 ‚àà G$ with initial energy level $e_0 ‚àà \abstractenergies$.
:::

::: {#def-energy-level}
#### Energy Level

For a finite play $œÅ = {g_0}{g_1}‚Ä¶{g_{n-1}} ‚àà G^{*}$ of $\game^üó≤(g_0, e_0)$, its energy level $\energylevel(œÅ)$ is computed recursively:

- $\energylevel(g_0) ‚âî e_0$
- $\energylevel(g_0‚Ä¶{g_{i+1}}) ‚âî
  \begin{cases}
    \abstractupdate({g_{i}},{g_{i+1}})(\energylevel(g_0‚Ä¶{g_{i}})) & \text{if } \energylevel(g_0‚Ä¶{g_{i}}) \neq ‚ä• \\
    ‚ä•  & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$

{{<noindent>}} For infinite plays $œÅ \in G^œâ$, we define energy levels to equal $‚ä•$.

We consider the attacker to be energy-bound and understand $\energylevel(œÅ) = ‚ä•$ to mean that they have run out of energy.
Thus, we declare plays with $\energylevel(œÅ) = ‚ä•$ to be won by the defender.
:::

We lift positional strategies of @def-strategies to be *energy-positional* in the sense that they pick next moves depending on the current energy level, i.e.\ $\rel F ‚äÜ (G_\attacker √ó \abstractenergies √ó G)$.

Instead of a winning region as in @def-winning-region, we define *winning budgets* for game positions:

::: {#def-winning-budgets}
#### Winning Budgets

For each position $g_0 \in G$ of energy game $\game^üó≤$, the *attacker winning energy budgets*, $\attackerwins(g_0) \subseteq \abstractenergies$ are the energies $e_0$ where the attacker wins $\game^üó≤(g_0, e_0)$.
The defender winning budgets $\defenderwins$ are defined analogously.
:::

Classical energy games use $\nats$-vectors for energies and vector addition for updates.

::: {#exm-simple-energy-game}
Consider vector energies $\abstractenergies = \nats^2$ with point-wise order and the energy game with graph in @fig-simple-energy-game.
Edges are labeled by update vectors $\vec{u} \in \ints^2$, each representing an update function
$$e \mapsto
\begin{cases}
  e + \vec{u} & \text{if } e + \vec{u} \geq \zerovec \\
  ‚ä•        & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Simple energy game of @exm-simple-energy-game.
:::

Can the attacker win from $\literal{g_1}$ with energy $(0,0)$?

::: spoiler
No, as both outgoing moves would lead to $‚ä•$-energy and thus to the defender winning.

But if the attacker starts with budget $(0,2)$, they can take the upper path to $\literal{g_4}$ with energy $(2,1)$, from where both defender options lead to the defender being stuck in $\literal{g_6}$.

Also, if the attacker starts with $(2,1)$, they win through the lower $\literal{g_3}$-path.

Starting with less energy means that the defender has an option of bankrupting the attacker at $\literal{g_4}$.

Summing up our observations, $(0,2)$ and $(2,1)$ define a Pareto front of minimal budgets where the attacker wins from $\literal{g_4}$, as depicted in @fig-exm-pareto-front.

::: {#fig-exm-pareto-front .column-margin}

\begin{tikzpicture}[]
  \begin{scope}[rotate=45, scale=1]
    \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3.5,3.5);

  \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Attacker's Pareto front for $\literal{g_1}$ of example energy game.
:::
:::

We can notice two things from the example:

1. A *purely positional strategy would not suffice* for the defender to win reliably at $\literal{g_4}$.
  Say the game starts with energy $(1,1)$, that is, with a budget where the defender should win.
  Then, the level with either be $(0,1)$ or $(3,0)$ at $\literal{g_4}$.
  The defender has to either move to $\literal{g_5}$ or $\literal{g_6}$, depending on the play so far.
  So, either the defender must know the history, or at least the current energy level to make an ideal decision.
2. On this kind of energies, *attacker's winning budgets are upward-closed*, and defender budgets are downward-closed.
:::

::: {#prp-winning-budget-rules}
Given an energy game $\game$, the attacker winning budgets $\attackerwins^{\game}$ are characterized inductively by the following rules:
$$
\dfrac{
  g_\attacker \in G_\attacker \quad
  g_\attacker \gamemoveblank g' \quad
  \abstractupdate(g_\attacker, g')(e) \in \attackerwins^{\game}(g')
} {
  e \in \attackerwins^{\game}(g_\attacker)
}
$$
$$
\dfrac{
  g_\defender \in G_\defender \quad
  \forall u,g' \ldotp \; g_\defender \gamemoveblank g' \longrightarrow
  \abstractupdate(g_\defender, g')(e) \in \attackerwins^{\game}(g')
} {
  e \in \attackerwins^{\game}(g_\defender)
}
$$
:::
:::proof
TODO: Pointer to Caro
:::

::: {#rem-energy-reachability}
Ordinary reachability games can be seen as a special case of energy games with trivial energies, e.g.\ $\abstractenergies = \set{1}$ and $\abstractupdate(\cdot) = \identity{\abstractenergies}$.
:::

::: {#rem-energy-games-in-general}
We deviate in two important points from other work on energy games:

- In the literature, it is more common to consider the defender instead of the attacker to be energy-bound [e.g. @fjls2011energyGamesMulti].
  This choice follows the intuition that there is a party with scarce resources that wants to keep the system running.
  For our purposes, however we want to bound the resources of an attacker, which is no fundamental change.
  Still, one cannot have both at the same time: @kh2022energyGamesResourceBounded, studying both-bounded energy games, establish that their winner is only decidable if both parties have only one-dimensional energies.
- We have defined energy-reachability games more abstractly than is common:
  In other publications, energy games work on numbers with component-wise updates as seen in @exm-simple-energy-game.
  We do not demand this as, in the next sections, we will need updates that combine information from different components of the energy vector.
  Even prior generalizations on energy update functions such as @eflq2013kleeneEnergyProblems does not allow sufficient flexibility in this regard.

### Declining Energy Games

An $N$-dimensional declining energy game is played on energy vectors:

::: {#def-energy-updates}
#### Energies and Energy Updates

For dimensionality $N$, the set of *energies*, $\energies$, is given by $(\nats \cup \set{\infty})^N$.

The set of *energy update labels*, $\energyupdates$, contains $\vectorcomponents[N]{u} \in \energyupdates$ where each component $u_k$ is a symbol of the form

- $u_k \in \set{-1, 0}$ (relative update), or
- $u_k = \mathtt{min}_D$ where $D \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ and $k \in D$ (minimum selection update).

{{<noindent>}} Applying an update to an energy, $\energyupdate(e, u)$, where $e = \vectorcomponents[N]{e} \in \energies$ and $u = \vectorcomponents[N]{u} \in \energyupdates$, yields a new energy vector $e'$ where $k$th components $e'_k ‚âî e_k + u_k$ for $u_k \in \ints$ and $e'_k ‚âî \min_{d\in D} e_d$ for $u_k = \mathtt{min}_D$.
Updates that would cause any component to become negative yield $\bot$.
:::

::: {#exm-energy-update}
Consider the update label $(\updmin{1,2},0,-1)$.

- $\energyupdate((1,1,0), (\updmin{1,2},0,-1))$ equals $\bot$ because of the last component.
- $\energyupdate((2,1,1), (\updmin{1,2},0,-1))$ equals $(1,1,0)$.
- $\energyupdate((1,1,1), (\updmin{1,2},0,-1))$ equals $(1,1,0)$, as well.
- There is no $e \in \energies$ such that $\energyupdate(e, (\updmin{1,2},0,-1)) = (1,0,0)$, because the second component would demand a lower first component.

In summary, $\energyupdate((\updmin{1,2},0,-1), \cdot)$ is neither injective nor surjective with respect to $\energies$.
The same is true for most other $u$ and $\energyupdate(u, \cdot)$ with a $\mathtt{min}$-update component.
:::

::: {#def-declining-energy-game}
#### Declining Energy Game

Given a weight labeling $w \colon (\gamemoveblank) \to \energyupdates$, an $N$-dimensional *declining energy game* $\game^üó≤$ is an energy reachability game with energies $\abstractenergies ‚âî \energies$ and with edges labeled $\abstractupdate(m) ‚âî \energyupdate(w(m), \cdot)$.

We write $g \gamemove{\;u\;} g'$ for a move $g \gamemoveblank g'$ labeled by weight $w(g, g') = u$.
:::

Declining energy games differ from more common energy games with vector addition updates as seen in @exm-simple-energy-game due to the potential non-invertibility of updates we encountered in @exm-energy-update.

::: {#prp-declining-energies}
In this model, energy levels can only decline.

- Updates may only decrease energies, $\energyupdate(u, e) \leq e$.
- Energy level changes are monotonic:
  If $\energylevel(\rho g) \leq \energylevel(\sigma g)$ and $g \gamemoveblank g'$
  then $\energylevel(\rho g g') \leq \energylevel(\sigma g g')$.
- If $e_0 \leq e'_0$ and $\game^üó≤(g_0, e_0)$ has non-$\bot$ play $\rho$, then $\game^üó≤(g_0, e'_0)$ also has non-$\bot$ play $\rho$.

## Characterizing the $\complexityname{P}$-Time Part of the Spectrum

As hinted at in Subsection [-@sec-equivalence-complexities], parts of the strong equivalence spectrum can be decided in polynomial time, whereas others require polynomial space (and thus effectively exponential time).
In this section, we will show how to adapt the standard bisimulation game of @def-bisim-game to decide not just bisimulation, but *all polynomial-time* equivalences of the strong spectrum *at once*.

### The Polynomial Slice

First, let us make explicit which equivalences we include in the polynomial-time slice of the spectrum.
(The fact that they indeed can be decided efficiently is mostly well-known, but also itself a corollary of this section.)

To define the polynomial slice, we only use three dimensions:
1.\ modal depth, 2.\ depth of negative clauses, and 3.\ nesting depth of negations (that is, the first, fifth and sixth dimension of the strong spectrum @def-strong-spectrum).
Components for other dimensions of the strong spectrum are effectively set to $‚àû$.

::: {#def-polynomial-strong-spectrum}

#### Polynomial-Time Strong Spectrum

We denote as *polynomial-time strong spectrum* the projection of the strong spectrum (@def-strong-spectrum) to the first, fifth, and sixth dimension, thus by notions
$$\notions^\literal{poly-strong} ‚âî
\natsext^3,
$$
and the family of strong observation languages
$$\observationsvar{(N_1, N_2, N_3) \in \notions^\literal{poly-strong}}^\literal{poly-strong} ‚âî \observationsvar{(N_1,‚àû,‚àû,‚àû,N_2,N_3)}^\literal{strong}.$$
:::

@fig-polynomial-strong-spectrum gives names to coordinates that correspond to notions discussed previously.

```
Hierarchy of polynomial-time decidable equivalences/preorders.
:::

Except for enabledness, $\notionname{E}$, all coordinates after unfolding them for $\notions^\literal{strong}$ are identical to the ones used previously.
When one unfolds the coordinate for enabledness $(1,0,0)$ to the original strong system, $(1,‚àû,‚àû,‚àû,0,0)$, it differs from the one previously used, namely, $(1,0,0,0,0,0)$.
The characterized language is strictly more expressive, as it contains conjunctions of enabled actions (e.g. $\hmlands\set{\hmlobs{\literal{a}}, \hmlobs{\literal{b}}}$), but it is equally distinctive.{{<isb lemma Priced_Spectrum lts.enabledness_conjunctions_are_neutral>}}

### The Bisimulation *Energy* Game

Let us upgrade the bisimulation game of @def-bisim-game with energies.
The claim is that the resulting game ${\game}_\notionname{B}^üó≤$ will characterize all equivalences of the polynomial-time strong spectrum in the sense that
$p \bpreordvar{\observationsvar{e}} q$ for $e \in \notions^\literal{poly-strong}$ precisely if the defender wins ${\game}_\notionname{B}^üó≤$ from $[p, q]$ with budget $e$.

As we have seen in Subsection [-@sec-bisim-game-hml], the game moves match the distinctive power of productions in the $\observations{\floor{B}}$-grammar of @exm-game-formulas.
Consequently, we can *count* the use of HML constructs in the game.
As the game stands, we can meaningfully count: 1.\ modal depth, 2.\ depth of negative clauses, and 3.\ nesting depth of negations (that is, the first, fifth and sixth dimension of the strong spectrum @def-strong-spectrum).
We cannot meaningfully count the amount of *necessary* conjunctions as the game's HML has conjunctions under each observation, even though they might not be necessary for a distinguishing formula.
Adding the respective energy updates to the bisimulation game, we obtain:

::: {#def-bisim-energy-game}
#### Bisimulation Energy Game

For a transition system $\system$, the *bisimulation energy game* ${\game}_\notionname{B}^{üó≤\system}$ is played on the same graph as the *bisimulation game* ${\game}_\notionname{B}^{\system}$ (of @def-bisim-game), but the moves are weighted by the following energy updates:

- Attacker swaps are counted as a negation and limit the further observations to the depth of negative clauses:
  $$[p, q] \quad \gamemove{\updmin{1,2},0,-1}^üó≤_\notionname{B} \quad [q, p].$$
- Simulation challenges count as an observation (using up the budget for modal depth):
  $$[p, q] \quad \gamemove{-1,0,0}^üó≤_\notionname{B} \quad (Œ±, p', q) \quad \text{if} \quad p \step{Œ±} p'.$$
- And defender answers come for free:
  $$(Œ±, p', q) \quad \gamemove{0,0,0}^üó≤_\notionname{B} \quad [p', q'] \quad \text{if} \quad q \step{Œ±} q'.$$
:::

The first dimension thus bounds how often the attacker may challenge simulation down the road,
the third limits how often they may swap sides,
and the middle dimension bounds the amount of simulation moves after a swap.

::: {#exm-bisim-sim-energy-game}

Let us label the bisimulation game of @exm-bisim-sim-game-formulas (distinguishing the ‚Äútrolled philosophers‚Äù) with energy updates.

The bisimulation energy game of @exm-bisim-sim-energy-game with energy updates.
:::

The attacker wins ${\game}^üó≤_\notionname{B}$ from $[\literal{Q}, \literal{Q'}]$ if they start out with an energy budget of $(2,2,2)$ or above.
But if the budget does not dominate this bound, the attacker loses.
For instance, neither $(1,\infty,\infty)$ nor $(\infty,\infty,1)$ is enough.
The second bound implies that the budgets, $(\infty,1,1)$ and $(\infty,0,0)$ are won by the defender as well.

Attacker's Pareto front for $[\literal{Q}, \literal{Q'}]$ of the example bisim energy game.
:::

On the game-side, this tells us is that the attacker needs at least two simulation moves (after swaps) and two swaps to tell $\literal{Q}$ apart from $\literal{Q'}$.
Telling apart $\literal{Q'}$ from $\literal{Q}$ is slightly easier, only requiring one swap (and only one simulation move after the swap).

But, due to the correspondence of the game to modal formulas and of the energy updates to the pricing of formulas in the spectrum, the attacker winning budgets tell us more:
They reveal that one needs two observations and two (or more) negations to distinguish $\literal{Q}$ from $\literal{Q'}$ using formulas from $\observations{\floor{B}}$.

Thus, $\notions^{\literal{poly-strong}}_{\literal{Q}, \literal{Q'}} = \set{N \in \notions^\literal{poly-strong} \mid N \nleq (2,2,2)}$ is the solution for the (polynomial-time strong) spectroscopy problem.
$\literal{Q}$ is preordered to $\literal{Q'}$ by 2-nested simulation, 1-step bisimulation, and all notions below;
but distinguished by all above, in particular, 3-nested simulation and 2-step bisimulation.

This is in line with the solution we thought of for the original strong spectrum in @exm-spectroscopy-front.
:::

### Correctness of Characterization

We now sketch how to prove that the bisimulation energy game indeed characterizes the equivalences of the polynomial-time strong spectrum.
In following chapters, we will prove stronger results for more general games in more detail.
The approach is to generalize the connection between winning attacks and distinguishing formulas that we have already explored in @lem-attacks-imply-formulas and @lem-formulas-imply-attack to energies and spectrum.

Thus, we have established that the bisimulation energy game ${\game}_\notionname{B}^üó≤$ characterizes the equivalences of the polynomial-time strong spectrum $\notions^\literal{poly-strong}$.
To use exploit this property to decide equivalences and solve the spectroscopy problem algorithmically, we need one more ingredient:
A decision procedure for winning budgets in declining energy games.

## How to Decide Declining Energy Games

This section is about how to compute which energy budgets are winning for the attacker (or the defender) at positions of an energy game:

::: {#def-energy-game-problem}
#### Monotone Energy Game Winner Problem

In the context of an energy system $(\abstractenergies, \leq)$ and a finite energy game $\game^üó≤=(G,G_\defender,\gamemoveblank, \abstractupdate)$, the *energy game winner problem* goes:
- Input:  A game position $g \in G$.
- Output: Pareto front of minimal winning budget for the attacker at g, $\attackerwinsmin(g)$.
:::

We will show how to solve the problem for energy games with monotone updates.
To this end, we will adapt the idea of back-propagating how the defender loses in reachability games from @alg-deciding-games.

The change is that we have to propagate not just attacker wins, but Pareto fronts of attacker-winning energy levels.
For this, we have to invert the energy update functions.
But, as we have seen in @exm-energy-update, our specific declining energy updates are neither injective, and thus cannot be cleanly inverted.

We will see how to tackle these challenges using Galois connections.
For details, readers are referred to @lemke2024multiweightedEnergyGames.

### Galois Connections

Galois connections can be thought of as a pair of *functions that invert each other up to some partial ordering relation*.
Another standard intuition is that Galois connections couple a *concrete* and a more *abstract* domain, and this is what the variable naming in the following definition alludes to.

::: {#def-galois-connection}
A *Galois connection* between two partially ordered sets $(C, \leq_C)$ and $(A,\leq_A)$ is a pair of functions $\alpha \colon C \to A$ and $\gamma \colon A \to C$ such that, for all $a \in A$ and $c \in C$:
$$\alpha(c) \leq_A a \iff c \leq_C \gamma(a).$$
:::

An illustration of the connection property can be seen in @fig-galois-connection.
(The illustration also illuminates why the $\alpha$-function is often referred to as ‚Äúlower adjoint‚Äú and $\gamma$ as ‚Äúupper adjoint‚Äù of a Galois connection.)

::: {#exm-galois-abstraction-reals}
Take the non-negative reals $\reals^{\geq 0}$ as concrete domain and the natural numbers $\nats$ as abstract domain.
Then, as function $\alpha_{\reals} \colon \reals^{\geq 0} \to \nats$, take flooring, $x \mapsto \floor{x}$, and for the other direction, the identity $\identity{\nats}$, $n \mapsto n$.
Clearly, $\floor{x} \leq n \iff x \leq n$.
Therefore, $\alpha_{\reals}$ and $\identity{\nats}$ form a Galois connection.

:::

The following example motivates why one can say Galois connections abstract function inversion:

::: {#exm-galois-equality}
If a function $f \colon C \to A$ is surjective and injective, it has a unique inverse function $f^{-1} \colon A \to C$ such that $f^{-1} \circ f = \identity{C}$ and $f \circ f^{-1} = \identity{A}$.

If $f$ is monotone with respect to some partial orders on $A$ and $C$,
then both must be strictly monotone, and
$f$ and $f^{-1}$ must form a Galois connection, because
$$f(c) \leq_A a \implies f^{-1}(f(c)) \leq_A f^{-1}(a) \implies c \leq_C f^{-1}(a)$$
and
$$c \leq_C f^{-1}(a) \implies f(c) \leq_A f(f^{-1}(a)) \implies f(c) \leq_A a.$$
:::

This justifies why, in the following, we overload the notation for inversion to refer to adjoint functions that we use to undo energy updates.

### The Algorithm

For the algorithm, we have to assume that we know a function that ‚Äúundoes‚Äù energy updates, $\abstractupdateinv \colon (\gamemoveblank) \to (\abstractenergies \cup \set{\bot}) \to (\abstractenergies \cup \set{\bot})$ with $\abstractupdateinv(g, g')(e') = \inf \set{e \mid e' \leq_\bot \abstractupdate(g, g')(e)}$.

:::

The algorithm can be understood as a generalization of @alg-deciding-games, but as positions can be updated more than once, we have to depart from the option counting trick.

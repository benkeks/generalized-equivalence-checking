## Behavioral Difference

::: {#def-difference}
### Difference

The difference between $P$ and $Q$ is defined as:
$$\difference{P}{Q} := \semanticsObs{P} \setminus \semanticsObs{Q}.$$

### Behavioral preorder and equivalence

Two processes are preordered with respect to a behavioral equivalence $E \subseteq \hml$
$$P \bpreord{E} Q \defiff \difference{P}{Q} \cap E \subseteq \varnothing.$$
If $P \bpreord{E} Q$ and $Q \bpreord{E} P$, the two are considered $E$-equivalent, $P \beq{E} Q$.

### Bisimilarity

Two processes are bisimulation preordered (and moreover bisimilar)
$$P \beq{B} Q \defiff \difference{P}{Q} \subseteq \varnothing.$$
:::

<!-- That the relational characterization of bisimilarity and the modal characterization of @def-bisimilarity coincide, is due to @hm1980hml.
It makes sense to consider the $\hml$ characterization as primary.
Van Glabbeek [-@glabbeek2001ltbtsiReport;-@glabbeek1993ltbt] shows how all the other common equivalences can be understood to be a lattice of sublanguages of $\hml$. -->

#### Equivalence Spectra

An *equivalence spectrum* $(\notions, \leq, \observationsvar{N \in \notions})$ consists of

- a set of equivalence notions $\notions$,
- a partial order $\leq \; \subseteq \notions \times \notions$, and
- corresponding observations $\observationsvar{} \, \colon \notions \to \powerset{\hml}$.

For any two notions $N,M \in \notions$, $N \leq M$ implies $\observationsvar{N} \subseteq \observationsvar{M}$.

These bisimulation relations preserve CSP semantics, as well as the operational semantics of programs in other languages with operational semantics described by such GLTSs and relying only on observational equivalence. They can therefore be used to combat the space explosion problem faced in explicit model checking for such languages. We concentrate on algorithms which work efficiently when implemented rather than on ones which have low asymptotic growth.},

Methods for calculating a general equivalence, namely bisimulation equivalence, and a general preorder are described and shown to be useful as a basis for calculating other semantic relations as well. Two general classes of algorithms are considered: global ones, which require the a priori construction of the state space but are generally more efficient in the asymptotic case, and local, or on-the-fly ones, which avoid the construction of unnecessary states while incurring some additional computational overhead.}

It is obtained by taking a semantic equivalence from the linear time -- branching time spectrum, namely divergence-preserving coupled similarity, and showing that it is a congruence for the operators of CSP. This equivalence belongs to the bisimulation family of semantic equivalences, in the sense that on transition systems without internal actions it coincides with strong bisimilarity. Nevertheless, enough of the equational laws of CSP remain to obtain a complete axiomatisation for closed, recursion-free terms.",

  abstract="We study a new formulation of bisimulation for the $\pi$-calculus [MPW92], which we have called open bisimulation ( ∼ ). In contrast with the previously known bisimilarity equivalences, ∼ is preserved by all $\pi$-calculus operators, including input prefix. The differences among all these equivalences already appear in the sublanguage without name restrictions: Here the definition of ∼ can be factorised into a ``standard'' part which, modulo the different syntax of actions, is the CCS bisimulation, and a part specific to the $\pi$-calculus, which requires name instantiation. Attractive features of ∼ are: A simple axiomatisation (of the finite terms), with a completeness proof which leads to the construction of minimal canonical representatives for the equivalence classes of ∼; an ``efficient'' characterisation, based on a modified transition system. This characterisation seems promising for the development of automated-verification tools and also shows the call-by-need flavour of ∼. Although in the paper we stick to the $\pi$-calculus, the issues developed may be relevant to value-passing calculi in general.",

We try to answer this question by describing two general methods that can be used to construct direct one-to-one polynomial-time reductions from bisimulation equivalence to simulation preorder (and simulation equivalence). These methods can be applied to many classes of finitely generated transition systems, provided that they satisfy certain abstractly formulated conditions. Roughly speaking, our first method works for all classes of systems that can test for `non-enabledness' of actions, while our second method works for all classes of systems that are closed under synchronization.},

We classify these models by their expressiveness and define a hierarchy of classes of rewrite systems. We show that this hierarchy is strict with respect to bisimulation equivalence. The most general and most expressive class of systems in this hierarchy is called process rewrite systems (PRS). They subsume Petri nets, PA-processes, and pushdown processes and are strictly more expressive than any of these. Intuitively, PRS can be seen as an extension of Petri nets by subroutines that can return a value to their caller. We show that the reachability problem is decidable for PRS. It is even decidable if there is a reachable state that satisfies certain properties that can be encoded in a simple logic. Thus, PRS are more expressive than Petri nets, but not Turing-powerful.}

The minimal automata can be seen as canonical representations of the behaviour modulo the bisimilarity considered. Together with congruence results wrt. process algebraic operators, this can be exploited to alleviate the notorious state space explosion problem. In this paper, we aim at identifying minimal automata and canonical representations for concurrent probabilistic models. We present minimality and canonicity results for probabilistic automata wrt. strong and weak bisimilarity, together with polynomial time minimization algorithms.},

  abstract="This work introduces a notion of approximate probabilistic trace equivalence for labelled Markov chains, and relates this new concept to the known notion of approximate probabilistic bisimulation. In particular this work shows that the latter notion induces a tight upper bound on the approximation between finite-horizon traces, as expressed by a total variation distance. As such, this work extends corresponding results for exact notions and analogous results for non-probabilistic models. This bound can be employed to relate the closeness in satisfaction probabilities over bounded linear-time properties, and allows for probabilistic model checking of concrete models via abstractions. The contribution focuses on both finite-state and uncountable-state labelled Markov chains, and claims two main applications: firstly, it allows an upper bound on the trace distance to be decided for finite state systems; secondly, it can be used to synthesise discrete approximations to continuous-state models with arbitrary precision.",

  abstract    = {Discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains as well as interactive
	Markov chains are widely used model classes for the analysis of
	stochastic systems. A fundamental problem thereby is the number of
	states, which in general grows exponentially in the size of the
	corresponding high-level model.\par
	In this work we develop two methods to cope with this problem. The
	first one consists of the computation of a system with a minimal
	number of states and the same observable behavior as the original
	system. This allows us to carry out any analysis with well-known
	algorithms on the minimal system. Depending on the definition of
	observability we obtain different minimal systems. Our algorithm is
	able to handle a large number system types and minimization criteria
	which are considered practically relevant in the literature. Our
	method works with symbolic data structures and dedicated operations
	thereon whose runtime only depends on the size of the representation
	instead of the size of the represented system. The size of the
	symbolic representation of many real-world systems, however, is
	smaller by orders of magnitudes than the system itself. Experimental
	results prove the efficiency of our algorithm.\par
	The other method to handle large state spaces is to develop algorithms
	which are directly applicable to large systems. For the refutation of
	safety properties in digital circuits a method called Bounded Model
	Checking has been developed, which is nowadays successfully applied
	also in industry. We show how Bounded Model Checking can be adapted to
	compute counterexamples for discrete-time Markov chains if a given
	safety property is violated. By a number of optimization technique we
	can reduce not only the runtime but also the size of the
	counterexamples. The result is a method which is able to handle
	significantly larger systems than the previously available algorithms.},

  abstract = {The original theoretical model of Communicating Sequential Processes owed its inspiration to the achievements of Milner, Scott and Dijkstra. It was developed at around the time of the publication of Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems. Why ever did CSP diverge from CCS? The ESPRIT basic research action 'CONCUR' brought together the proponents of three of the original calculi of concurrency: ACP, CCS and CSP. It was hoped that we would develop a unified calculus, and concur upon its adoption. Why ever did we fail? I would like to share with you the way in which I thought about these questions twenty five years ago. Since then, many excellent comparative studies have been conducted. As a result, we can now see how such theories can best be unified, without assimilation of their distinctive features or compromise of their distinctive merits.}

Firstly, the mCRL2 language has been extended to support the modelling of probabilistic behaviour. Furthermore, the usability has been improved with the addition of refinement checking, counterexample generation and a user-friendly GUI. Finally, several performance improvements have been made in the treatment of behavioural equivalences. Besides the changes to the toolset itself, we cover recent applications of mCRL2 in software product line engineering and the use of domain specific languages (DSLs).",

This equivalence problem in CCS is presented as a refinement of the familiar problem of testing whether two nondeterministic finite state automata (n.f.s.a.) accept the same language. Three notions of equivalence, proposed for CCS, are investigated: (1) observation equivalence, (2) congruence, and (3) failure equivalence. We show that observation equivalence (@@@@) can be tested in cubic time and is the limit of a sequence of equivalence notions (@@@@k), where, @@@@1 is the familiar n.f.s.a. equivalence and, for each fixed k, @@@@k is PSPACE-complete. We provide an O(nlogn) test for congruence for n state processes of bounded fanout, by extending the algorithm that minimizes the states of d.f.s.a.'s. Finally, we show that, even for a very restricted type of process, testing for failure equivalence is PSPACE-complete.},

abstract="A new algorithm for bisimilarity minimization of labelled directed graphs is presented. Its time consumption is O(m logn), where n is the number of states and m is the number of transitions. Unlike earlier algorithms, it meets this bound even if the number of different labels of transitions is not fixed. It is based on refining a partition on states with respect to the labelled transitions. A splitter is a pair consisting of a set in the partition and a label. Earlier algorithms consume lots of time in scanning splitters that have no corresponding relevant transitions. The new algorithm avoids this by maintaining the sets of the corresponding transitions. To facilitate this, a refinable partition data structure with amortized constant time operations is introduced. Detailed pseudocode and correctness proof are presented, as well as some measurements.",

  abstract="In process algebras, a congruence is an equivalence that remains valid when any subsystem is replaced by an equivalent one. Whether or not an equivalence is a congruence depends on the set of operators used in building systems from subsystems. Numerous congruences have been found, differing from each other in fine details, major ideas, or both, and none of them is good for all situations. The world of congruences seems thus chaotic, which is unpleasant, because the notion of congruence is at the heart of process algebras. This study continues attempts to clarify the big picture by proving that in certain sub-areas, there are no other congruences than those that are already known or found in the study. First, the region below stability-preserving fair testing equivalence is surveyed using an exceptionally small set of operators. The region contains few congruences, which is in sharp contrast with an earlier result on the region below Chaos-Free Failures Divergences (CFFD) equivalence, which contains 40 well-known and not well-known congruences. Second, steps are taken towards a general theory of dealing with initial stability, which is a small but popular detail. This theory is applied to the region below CFFD.",

In this paper we describe the operation of FDR3 at a high level and then give a detailed description of several of its more important innovations. This includes the new multi-core refinement-checking algorithm that is able to achieve a near linear speed up as the number of cores increase. Further, we describe the new algorithm that FDR3 uses to construct its internal representation of CSP processes---this algorithm is more efficient than FDR2's, and is able to compile a large class of CSP processes to more efficient internal representations. We also present experimental results that compare FDR3 to related tools, which show it is unique (as far as we know) in being able to scale beyond the bounds of main memory.},

abstract="Partition refinement is a method for minimizing automata and transition systems of various types. Recently, we have developed a partition refinement algorithm that is generic in the transition type of the given system and matches the run time of the best known algorithms for many concrete types of systems, e.g. deterministic automata as well as ordinary, weighted, and probabilistic (labelled) transition systems. Genericity is achieved by modelling transition types as functors on sets, and systems as coalgebras. In the present work, we refine the run time analysis of our algorithm to cover additional instances, notably weighted automata and, more generally, weighted tree automata. For weights in a cancellative monoid we match, and for non-cancellative monoids such as (the additive monoid of) the tropical semiring even substantially improve, the asymptotic run time of the best known algorithms. We have implemented our algorithm in a generic tool that is easily instantiated to concrete system types by implementing a simple refinement interface. Moreover, the algorithm and the tool are modular, and partition refiners for new types of systems are obtained easily by composing pre-implemented basic functors. Experiments show that even for complex system types, the tool is able to handle systems with millions of transitions.",

This issue has been traditionally addressed by developing, for a specific process semantics, a syntactic format for operational semantics specifications. We suggest a novel, orthogonal approach, which focuses on a specific process operator and determines a class of congruence relations for this operator. To this end, we impose syntactic restrictions on Hennessy–Milner logic, so that a process semantics whose modal characterization satisfies those criteria is guaranteed to be a congruence with respect to the operator in question. We investigate alternative composition, action prefix, projection, encapsulation, renaming, and parallel composition with communication, in the context of both concrete and weak process semantics.",

abstract="Coalgebra, as the abstract study of state-based systems, comes naturally equipped with a notion of behavioural equivalence that identifies states exhibiting the same behaviour. In many cases, however, this equivalence is finer than the intended semantics. Particularly in automata theory, behavioural equivalence of nondeterministic automata is essentially bisimilarity, and thus does not coincide with language equivalence. Language equivalence can be captured as behavioural equivalence on the determinization, which is obtained via the standard powerset construction. This construction can be lifted to coalgebraic generality, assuming a so-called Eilenberg-Moore distributive law between the functor determining the type of accepted structure (e.g. word languages) and a monad capturing the branching type (e.g. nondeterministic, weighted, probabilistic). Eilenberg-Moore-style coalgebraic semantics in this sense has been shown to be essentially subsumed by the more general framework of graded semantics, which is centrally based on graded monads. Graded semantics comes with a range of generic results, in particular regarding invariance and, under suitable conditions, expressiveness of dedicated modal logics for a given semantics; notably, these logics are evaluated on the original state space. We show that the instantiation of such graded logics to the case of Eilenberg-Moore-style semantics works extremely smoothly, and yields expressive modal logics in essentially all cases of interest. We additionally parametrize the framework over a quantale of truth values, thus in particular covering both the two-valued notions of equivalence and quantitative ones, i.e. behavioural distances.",

abstract = {We prove that three semantics for the applied π-calculus coincide – a testing semantics, a labelled equivalence, and a modal logic – and explain how design decisions in each of these semantics are objectively supported by this convergence. Each of these semantics has a distinct role when verifying security protocols. Testing semantics are suited to security and privacy problems expressed in terms of a process equivalence problem, where tests define the space of attack strategies. A labelled equivalence is suited to proving the given equivalence problem when such security and privacy properties hold; while, dually, the modal logic describes attacks when such security or privacy properties are violated. For this particular investigation into this good-practice design pattern, we select what is perhaps the most powerful (interleaving) testing semantics: open barbed bisimilarity. Selecting open barbed bisimilarity comes with the bonus that it is a congruence hence is suited to compositional reasoning. This reference testing semantics leads to a notion of quasi-open bisimilarity and an intuitionistic modal logic for the applied π-calculus. We argue that, since we characterise the finest (interleaving) testing semantics and tests are attack strategies, our intuitionistic modal logic can describe all attacks whenever a privacy property expressed as an equivalence problem fails.}

abstract = {Process equivalences are formal methods that relate programs and systems which, informally, behave in the same way. Since there is no unique notion of what it means for two dynamic systems to display the same behaviour there are a multitude of formal process equivalences, ranging from bisimulation to trace equivalence, categorised in the linear-time branching-time spectrum. We present a logical framework based on an expressive modal fixpoint logic which is capable of defining many process equivalence relations: for each such equivalence there is a fixed formula which is satisfied by a pair of processes if and only if they are equivalent with respect to this relation. We explain how to do model checking for this logic in EXPTIME. This allows model checking technology to be used for process equivalence checking. We introduce two fragments of the logic for which it is possible to do model-checking in PTIME and PSPACE respectively, and show that the formulas that define the process equivalences we consider are in one of these fragments. This yields a generic proof technique for establishing the complexities of these process equivalences. Finally, we show how partial evaluation can be used to obtain decision procedures for process equivalences from the generic model checking scheme.}

These are games played on finite weighted automata and concern the existence of infinite runs subject to boundary constraints on the accumulated weight, allowing e.g only for behaviours where a resource is always available (nonnegative accumulated weight), yet does not exceed a given maximum capacity. We extend energy games to a multiweighted and parameterized setting, allowing us to model systems with multiple quantitative aspects. We present reductions between Petri nets and multiweighted automata and among different types of multiweighted automata and identify new complexity and (un)decidability results for both one- and two-player games.

The parallel timer processes are defined in a dense time domain and are able to model both concurrent (with delay intervals overlapping on the time axis) and infinite behaviour. Both the strong and weak (abstracted from internal actions) bisimulation equivalence problems for PTPs are proved decidable. It is proved also that, if one provides the PTP model additionally with memory cells for moving timer value information along the time axis, the bisimulation equivalence (and even the vertex reachability) problems become undecidable.",

A partially ordered set is called well-partially-ordered if every subset has at least one, but only a finite number, of minimal elements. For sequences s and t, we define s ⩽ t if some subsequence of t majorizes s term by term. Then the space of all finite sequences over a well-partially-ordered set is itself well-partially-ordered.}

abstract = {In mean-payoff games, the objective of the protagonist is to ensure that the limit average of an infinite sequence of numeric weights is nonnegative. In energy games, the objective is to ensure that the running sum of weights is always nonnegative. Multi-mean-payoff and multi-energy games replace individual weights by tuples, and the limit average (resp., running sum) of each coordinate must be (resp., remain) nonnegative. We prove finite-memory determinacy of multi-energy games and show inter-reducibility of multi-mean-payoff and multi-energy games for finite-memory strategies. We improve the computational complexity for solving both classes with finite-memory strategies: we prove coNP-completeness improving the previous known EXPSPACE bound. For memoryless strategies, we show that deciding the existence of a winning strategy for the protagonist is NP-complete. We present the first solution of multi-mean-payoff games with infinite-memory strategies: we show that mean-payoff-sup objectives can be decided in NP∩coNP, whereas mean-payoff-inf objectives are coNP-complete.}

This framework subsumes two classic game problems: parity games on vector addition systems with states (vass) and multidimensional energy parity games. We show that the multidimensional energy parity game problem is inter-reducible with a subclass of single-sided parity games on vass where just one player can modify the integer counters and the opponent can only change control-states. Our main result is that the minimal elements of the upward-closed winning set of these single-sided parity games on vass are computable. This implies that the Pareto frontier of the minimal initial credit needed to win multidimensional energy parity games is also computable, solving an open question from the literature. Moreover, our main result implies the decidability of weak simulation preorder/equivalence between finite-state systems and vass, and the decidability of model checking vass with a large fragment of the modal $\mu$-calculus.",

When applied to this class of verification problems, traditional (infinite-state) symbolic model checkers suffer from the state explosion problem even for very small examples. We provide BDD-like data structures to represent in a compact way collections of upwards closed sets over numerical domains.

The tool is primarily designed for educational purposes and it supports the classical process algebra CCS together with its timed extension TCCS. It allows to compare processes with respect to a range of strong/weak and timed/untimed equivalences and preorders (bisimulation, simulation and traces) and supports model checking of CCS/TCCS processes against recursively defined formulae of Hennessy-Milner logic. The tool offers a graphical visualizer for displaying labelled transition systems, including their minimization up to strong/weak bisimulation, and process behaviour can be examined by playing (bi)simulation and model checking games or via the generation of distinguishing formulae for non-equivalent processes. We describe the modelling and analysis features of Caal, discuss the underlying verification algorithms and show a typical example of a use in the classroom environment.",

  abstract="With the purpose of unifying a number of approaches to energy problems found in the literature, we introduce generalized energy automata. These are finite automata whose edges are labeled with energy functions that define how energy levels evolve during transitions. Uncovering a close connection between energy problems and reachability and B{\"u}chi acceptance for semiring-weighted automata, we show that these generalized energy problems are decidable. We also provide complexity results for important special cases.",

abstract = {We present a distance-agnostic approach to quantitative verification. Taking as input an unspecified distance on system traces, or executions, we develop a game-based framework which allows us to define a spectrum of different interesting system distances corresponding to the given trace distance. Thus we extend the classic linear-time–branching-time spectrum to a quantitative setting, parametrized by trace distance. We also prove a general transfer principle which allows us to transfer counterexamples from the qualitative to the quantitative setting, showing that all system distances are mutually topologically inequivalent.}

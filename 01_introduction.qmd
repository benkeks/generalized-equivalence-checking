# Introduction: What's the difference?

A long time ago, when working as a student research assistant, I was tasked with implementing a translation from the process algebra Timed CSP to Timed Automata.
The aim was to bridge between the tools FDR2 and UPPAAL for Thomas Göthel's dissertation [-@goethel12mechanicalVerificationRTS].
The previous works I was to base the translations on had serious flaws:
One introduced spurious deadlocks to the model, the other was unable to handle nesting of choices and parallel composition.
Clearly, we had to change the encoding!

… But how to tell whether our adapted translation would properly honor the semantics of CSP and Timed Automata?
Did we translate CSP terms to automata *with the same meaning*?
This leads to the question of what counts as *same meaning* in operational semantics.
I took my very first look into an ominous paper on the landscape of process equivalences, the “Linear-time–branching-time spectrum II” by Rob van Glabbeek [-@glabbeek1993ltbt].
The central figure, reproduced in @fig-ltbts2-paper, mesmerized me.
How could be so many different notions of equivalence!

The paper did not really help me back then:
I could not wrap my head around the host of equivalences.
But the fascination remained.
This thesis is about an idea how future researchers can tap into the wisdom of the linear-time–branching-time spectrum and quickly learn what equivalences relate their models.

Can you subtract two programs?
Or even more generally:
Can you subtract a specification from a program to see what unspecified behavior remains?
(For your program to be correct, there should be no relevant difference!)

There is a rich body of work on *process equivalence checking* and *refinement checking* for programs and specifications.
This thesis argues that most of it can be viewed through one unified lense of *finding differences* in behavior.

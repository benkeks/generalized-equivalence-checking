# Generalized Equivalence Checking of Concurrent Programs

This is a WIP version of [Benjamin Bisping's](https://bbisping.de) dissertation on how to decide all behavioral equivalences of processes at once, using a quantitative game approach.

The Web preview of this work is live on:

As of 2025-01, several chapters are still to be written. (Mainly those on work that has already been published in / presented at [LMCS'22](https://doi.org/10.46298/lmcs-18(3:19)2022), [CAV'23](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37706-8_5), and [EXPRESS/SOS'24](https://doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.412.6).)

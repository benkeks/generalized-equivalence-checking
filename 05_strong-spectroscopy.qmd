The energy game approach can in fact be leveraged to solve the spectroscopy problem for the whole of the strong equivalence spectrum.
This chapter showcases the main result of my paper “Process Equivalence Problems as Energy Games” [@bisping2023equivalenceEnergyGames].

The core ingredient of this chapter is a richer energy game, to be presented in @sec-stong-spectro-game.
The bisimulation energy game of @sec-approach is not complex enough to capture all strong equivalences of @sec-spectrum.
It is “too easy” for the attacker in the sense that they can use conjunctions to account for every transition the defender might choose after each observation.
But the weaker notions of the spectrum heavily limit how many conjunctions may be used to name a distinction!

Our core trick will be to break the link between observations and conjunctions in the game, analogously to the subset construction on finite automata.

#### Breaking up observations and conjunctions

Linear-time notions can be addressed in the spectroscopy game by interjecting a subset-construction on defender states between moves that correspond to observations and to conjunctions.
:::

This will lead to exponential blow-up.
In @sec-specific-spectro-games, we will discuss how to get rid of the blowup where possible when instantiating the game to decide equivalences individually.

::: {#nte-idea-instance-games .callout-idea .callout-note}
#### Generating equvialence checkers

By instantiating the spectroscopy game with known initial energies and exploiting the supply of conjunction moves, we can derive efficient decision procedures for individual equivalences.

@fig-strong-spectroscopy-big-picture gives an overview of the two routes to decide equivalences collectively and individually we will explore.

## The Strong Spectroscopy Game {#sec-stong-spectro-game}


### The Game

As long as observations happen, the defender is moved to the set of states $Q$ reachable through non-determinism; only at conjunction moves does the defender have to choose a $q \in Q$.
Treating conjunctions more explicitly, will also allow us to track the depth of positive conjuncts in sufficient detail.

::: {#def-strong-spectroscopy-game}

For a system $\system=(\states,\actions,\step{})$,
the $6$-dimensional *strong spectroscopy energy game*
$\gamespectroscopy^{\system}=(G,G_{\defender},\gamemoveblank,w)$
consists of

- *attacker positions* $\attackerpos{p,Q} \in G_\attacker$,
- *attacker conjunct positions* $\attackerpos[\land]{p,q} \in G_\attacker$,
- *defender conjunction positions* $\defenderpos{p,Q,Q_*} \in G_\defender$,

\noindent
where $p, q \in \states$ and $Q, Q_* \in \powerset{\states}$, and six kinds of moves:
$$
\begin{array}{rrcll}
  \textit{observation}
  & \attackerpos{p,Q}
  & \gamemove{-1,0,0,0,0,0}
  & \attackerpos{p', Q'}
  & \text{if $p \step{\alpha} p^\prime$\!, $Q \step{\alpha} Q'$,}
  \\
  \textit{conjunction}
  & \attackerpos{p,Q}
  & \gamemove{0,0,0,0,0,0}
  & \defenderpos{p,Q \setminus Q_*, Q_*}
  & \text{if $Q_* \subseteq Q$,}
  \\
  \textit{conj.~revival}
  & \defenderpos{p,Q,Q_*}
  & \gamemove{\updmin{1,3},-1,0,0,0,0}
  & \attackerpos{p,Q_*}
  & \text{if $Q_* \neq \varnothing$,}
  \\
  \textit{conj.~answer}
  & \defenderpos{p,Q,Q_*}
  & \gamemove{0,-1,0,\updmin{3,4},0,0}
  & \attackerpos[\land]{p,q}
  & \text{if $q \in Q$,}
  \\
  \textit{positive conjunct}
  & \attackerpos[\land]{p,q}
  & \gamemove{\updmin{1,4},0,0,0,0,0}
  & \attackerpos{p,\{q\}},
  & \text{and}
  \\
  \textit{negative conjunct}
  & \attackerpos[\land]{p,q}
  & \gamemove{\updmin{1,5},0,0,0,0,-1}
  & \attackerpos{q,\{p\}}
  & \text{if $p \neq q$.}
    \\
\end{array}

:::

::: {#lem-spectroscopy-bisimulation-game}
$p_0$ and $q_0$ are bisimilar
iff the defender wins $\gamespectroscopy$ from $\attackerpos{p_0, \{q_0\}}$ with $e_0$ for every initial energy budget $e_0$,
that is, if $(\infty, \infty, \infty, \infty, \infty, \infty) \in \defenderwins(\attackerpos{p_0, \{q_0\}})$.^[
  Proof in Lemma 1 of @bisping2023equivalenceEnergyGamesReport.
]
:::

TODO: Example (just the old one?)

TODO: Example where the polynomial game would not see certain traces.

### Correctness

To prove correctness, we proceed as with the bisimulation energy game in @sec-correctness-poly-spectroscopy:
On the one hand, we show that game moves correspond to formulas of similar prices and that the attacker winning implies the formulas to be distinguishing.


::: {#thm-strong-spectroscopy-correctness}
For any notion of equivalence $e \in \notions^{\literal{strong}}$,
$p \bpreord{\observations{e}} q$, precisely if
$e_{pq} \nleq e$ for all $e_{pq} \in \attackerwins(\attackerpos{p, \{q\}})$.

### Complexity

### The Clever Game

### Instance Games

::: {#def-derived-reachability-game}

Given a declining energy game $\game = (G, G_\defender, \gamemoveblank, w)$,
the *derived reachability game* $\game^R = (G^R, G^R_\defender, \gamemoveblank_R)$ is played on tuples $G^R \defeq G \times (\energies_\infty \cup \{\bot\})$ with $G^R_\defender \defeq G_\defender \times \energies_\infty$.
Lifted moves $(g, e) \gamemoveblank_R (g', e')$ are possible iff
$e \neq \bot$ and if there is $u$ such that $g \gamemove{u} g'$ and $e' = \energyupdate(u, e)$.
(That is: positions with exhausted energies are stuck attacker positions.)

## Discussion

- Mention option of non-perfect attacker information as alternative to subset construction
- Difference to @bjn2022decidingAllBehavioralEqs:
  - Lower exponentiality in conjunctions
  - No explicit construction of formulas

# Introduction: What's the difference?

Can you subtract two programs?
Or even more generally:
Can you subtract a specification from a program to see what unspecified behavior remains?
(For your program to be correct, there should be no relevant difference!)

There is a rich body of work on *process equivalence checking* and *refinement checking* for programs and specifications.
This thesis argues that most of it can be viewed through one unified lense of *finding differences* in behavior.

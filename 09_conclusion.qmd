The main contribution of this thesis has been to solve @prob-spectroscopy-problem, the *spectroscopy problem*, deciding all behavioral preorders and equivalences of strong and weak spectrum, in one go.
To do this, we have provided *generalized game characterizations* for both spectra.
To turn these into decision procedures, we have developed a theory of *Galois energy games*.
Thanks to the decision procedures, we can offer *tool support* for equivalence spectroscopies.

Hierarchy of abstraction from strong bisimilarity to weak spectroscopy.
:::

- We have started at the *level of individual equivalences* by revisiting the classical Hennessy–Milner theorem on the dualism of modal distinguishability and behavioral relatability.
- @sec-preliminaries has revealed how relations and modal formulas in the Hennessy–Milner theorem are just *certificates* for defender and attacker strategies in the bisimulation reachability game.
- @sec-spectrum has taken us to the level of *spectra* of equivalence, following van Glabbeek's approach of a hierarchy of Hennessy–Milner theorems.
- On this level, @sec-approach has discovered that the bisimulation game just is an instance of the bisimulation *energy* game, which characterizes a small spectrum of $\complexityname{P}$-easy strong equivalences.
  We can use it in algorithms thanks to our decision procedure for such *Galois energy games*.
- The bisimulation energy game then again is only a lower-dimensional sibling of the *strong spectroscopy game*, which characterizes the full strong spectrum in @sec-strong-spectroscopy.
- With @sec-weak-spectrum, we have entered the level of van Glabbeek's [-@glabbeek1993ltbt] *weak spectrum*, where silent steps are abstracted.
- @sec-weak-spectorscopy has introduced the *weak spectroscopy game*, which could serve as strong spectroscopy game on systems without $\step{\tau}$-steps.

Framing this journey along Plato's allegory of the cave:
The Hennessy–Milner theorem *is a shadow* of the bisimulation game, which is a shadow of an energy game, which is a shadow of the strong spectroscopy game, which is a shadow of the weak spectroscopy game.
With the tool implementations of @sec-implementations, we have returned from the abstract realm of ideas back to the material level.

But in reality, there is no *ideal* hierachy of abstraction.
Our journey has crossed many routes by other researches and could have taken different paths.
Many interesting ones have been the topic of “Discussion” sections at the end of chapters.
Let us close by looking at some ways one could go from here.

{{< paragraph_heading "Blank spots." >}}
There are some classical points to extend research around this thesis. For instance:

- More formalization:
  Our Isabelle/HOL formalization of the weak spectroscopy strengthens many results of the thesis (thanks to the hierarchy of shadows, @fig-conclusion-big-picture).
  But so far, it does not cover revivals and thus failure-trace-like notions.
  The proofs in @bisping2023equivalenceEnergyGamesReport give some confidence that the construction is correct, but an Isabelle/HOL formalization would be even nicer.
- More Galois energy games:
  There exist some interesting questions around the theory of Galois energy games of @sec-approach and their generalizability to more game variants.^[
    Lemke and Bisping are already writing a paper on this.
  ]
- More tool support:
  Proliferation of spectroscopy features to more tools beyond @sec-implementations would be great.
  Our existing open source implementations hopefully can serve as good starting points.

{{< paragraph_heading "More spectra." >}}
Concurrency theory knows several other variants of linear-time--branching-time spectra.
For some, it might be worthwhile to try to adapt our approach of generalized game characterizations, maybe even the whole spectroscopy framework.

For probabilistic and quantitative bisimilarities there is recent work of “spectro-fication” in
@ba2017bisimTraceApproximate, @bdh2020probabilisticSpectrum, and @sbkpq2024approximateProbabilisticBisimulations.

barbed @Fournet2005

, forward/reverse bisimilaritis
- finiteness relies on fact that we can „forget” the transitions up to a configuration;  generality of @fahrenberg2014quantitativeLTBTS requires remembering traces.. likely the hardest

For timed equivalences, bisimulation checking is decidable, but trace preordering is not [@cerans1993decidabilityTimedBisim].

{{< paragraph_heading "A modal turn?" >}}

There is a rich body of work on *process equivalence checking* and *refinement checking* for programs and specifications.
This thesis argues that most of it can be viewed through one unified lense of *finding differences* in behavior.

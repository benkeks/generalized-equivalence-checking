# Context: The Spectrum of Equivalences {#sec-spectrum}

## Observability Hierarchies

@hm1980hml introduce HML as a “little language for talking about programs.”
The idea is that HML formulas express “experiments” or “tests” that an observer performs interacting with a program.
The intuition thus is that $\hml$ sublogics capture what we consider to be *observable*.
The more we mark as observable, the finer the resulting equivalence relations do become.

### Understanding the Equivalence Hierarchy through Modal Logics

As promised, we revisit the hierarchy between bisimilarity, similarity, and trace equivalence of Subsection [-@sec-hierarchy-equivalences], modally.
So far, we have only looked into the characterization of bisimilarity through the whole of $\hml$ in @thm-hennessy-milner or through $\observations{\floor{B}}$ in @exm-game-formulas.

::: {#def-sim-trace-logics}

We define the two $\hml$-sublogics $\observations{T}$, the linear positive fragment, and $\observations{S}$, the positive fragment, by the grammars starting at $φ^\mathrm{T}$ and $φ^\mathrm{S}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rclll}
  φ^\mathrm{T} & \grammardef &
    \hmlobs{α}φ^\mathrm{T}
    & \grammaror & \hmltrue \\
  φ^\mathrm{S} & \grammardef &
    \hmlobs{α}φ^\mathrm{S}
    & \grammaror & \hmland{i}{I}\hmlobs{α_i}φ^\mathrm{S}_i
\end{array}
$$
:::

{{<noindent>}} The logics characterize trace and simulation preorder (and equivalence):

::: {#lem-trace-logics}
$p \bpreord{T} q$ precisely if $p \bpreordvar{\observations{T}} q$.{{<isb theorem HML_Spectrum lts.observations_traces_characterizes_trace_preorder>}}
:::

::: {#lem-sim-logics}
$p \bpreord{S} q$ precisely if $p \bpreordvar{\observations{S}} q$.{{<isb theorem HML_Spectrum lts.observations_simulation_characterize_simulation_preorder>}}
:::

{{<noindent>}} Clearly, $\observations{T} \subset \observations{S} \subset \hml$.
So, @prp-difference-contraposition (together with @thm-hennessy-milner for $\beq{B}$ and $\hml$) yields another way of establishing the hierarchy between trace equivalence, similarity, and bisimilarity of Subsection [-@sec-hierarchy-equivalences].

While the relational definitions for (bi-)similarity of @def-bisimilarity and the denotational definition of trace equivalence @def-trace-eq live in different worlds, they become naturally comparable in the modal realm.

The modal view also reveals an intuitive hierarchy of “testing scenarios” for the equivalences, framed as black box tests:

Trace equivalence
: matches an observer that can see sequences of events.
They just watch repeated executions of the program.

Similarity
: matters to an experimenter that can also explore different branches of possibilities.
This is valid if the experimenter can somehow copy the system state during the execution.

Bisimilarity
: captures that the experimenter can moreover determine if a future course of events is impossible at some point.
This means that the experimenter can not only copy the execution state but also exhaustively test *every* possibility of how the system may continue.

But these levels of observability do not need to be linear …

### Incomparabilities

A well-known and natural notion of equivalence is that of *failure equivalence*.
Intuitively, a failure says that the experimenter may follow a trace and see which actions are *impossible* at its end.
Its standard definition is based on *failure* denotations:

::: {#def-failures}
#### Failures

The set of failures of a process $\failures{p}$ is recursively defined as

- $(\emptyword, X) ∈ \failures{p}$ if no $X \cap \initials{p} = \varnothing$,
- $(α \cdot \vec w, X) ∈ \failures{p}$ if there is $p'$ with $p \step α p'$ and $(\vec w, X) ∈ \failures{p'}$.
:::

But would it not be nice if we could prevent the invention of new mathematical objects for every new notions of observability we consider?
Fortunately, we can, by directly employing modal logics:

::: {#def-failures-modal}

We define failure observations $\observations{F}$ by the grammar:

$$
  φ^\mathrm{F} \grammardef
    \hmlobs{α}φ^\mathrm{F}
    \quad\grammaror\quad
    \hmland{i}{I} \hmlneg \hmlobs{α}\hmltrue 
$$
:::

Clearly, this encompasses what we may observe via traces,
but is something that we cannot observe using simulation.
We consider $\bpreord{F}$ given by $\bpreordvar{\observations{F}}$.

For instance, $\hmlobs{τ}\hmlands\set{\hmlneg\hmlobs{\literal a}\hmltrue} \in \observations{F}$, distinguishes $\literal P$ from $\literal Q$ on @fig-ts-determinism, but $\literal P \bpreord{S} \literal Q$ (cf. @exm-phil-sim).
On the other hand, no failure from $\observations{F}$, distinguishes $\literal Q$ from $\literal P$, but $\literal Q \nbpreord{S} \literal P$.

  Preorder/equivalence hierarchy.
::::

As a consequence, simulation preorder and failure preorder are incomparable, that is, neither one implies the other.
The same is true of the corresponding equivalences: similarity and failure equivalence.
The situation is summed up by the non-linear hierarchy in @fig-failure-hierarchy.

## The Linear-Time–Branching-Time Spectrum

Van Glabbeek's two papers on the “linear-time--branching-time spectrum” [-@glabbeek2001ltbtsiReport;-@glabbeek1993ltbt] show how all common equivalences can be understood to be a lattice of sublanguages of $\hml$ (and a variant of $\hml$ for equivalences with silent steps).
His hierarchy of equivalences derives from a hierarchy of *notions of observability*.^[In particular, the weak spectrum [@glabbeek1993ltbt] makes this really formal.]

### Observability Lattice

As we will discuss various equivalence spectra (van Glabbeek [-@glabbeek2001ltbtsiReport;-@glabbeek1993ltbt] already gives two different ones), let us first introduce an abstract description of such spectra.

::: {#def-spectrum}
#### Equivalence Spectrum

An *equivalence spectrum* $(\notions, \leq, \observationsvar{N \in \notions})$ consists of

- a set of notions of observability $\notions$,
- a partial order ${\leq} \subseteq \notions \times \notions$, and
- corresponding logics $\observationsvar{N} \colon \powerset{\hml}$ for $N \in \notions$.

It must hold, for any two notions $N,M \in \notions$, that
$$N \leq M \text{ implies } \observationsvar{N} \subseteq \observationsvar{M}.$$
:::

Effectively, we will be working with lattices $(\notions, \leq)$ of notions.

::: {#def-lattice}

#### Lattices and Bounds

A *lattice* is a partially ordered set $(B, \leq)$, where there are greatest lower bounds $\inf\set{b_1, b_2}$ and least upper bounds $\sup\set{b_1, b_2}$ between each pair of elements $b_1, b_2 \in B$.

The *greatest lower bound* of a set $B' \subseteq B$ is called its *infimum*, $\inf B'$.
It refers to the greatest element $b \in B$ such that $b \leq b'$ for all $b' \in B'$.^[
  Note that not necessarily $b \in B'$!
]

Dually, the *least upper bound* of a set $B' \subseteq B$ is called its *supremum*, $\sup B'$.
It refers to the least element $b \in B$ such that $b \geq b'$ for all $b' \in B'$.

For the pair-wise infimum we also use infix notation $b_1 \glb b_2 = \inf \set{b_1, b_2}$, and analogously $b_1 \lub b_2 = \sup \set{b_1, b_2}$.

If a lattice $(B, \leq)$ not only allows infima and suprema for pairs but for any set $B' \subseteq B$, it is called *complete*.
:::

::: {#exm-simple-spectrum}

Consider the notions
$$\notions^\literal{simple} ≔
\powerset{\set{\literal{(\land)}, \literal{(\neg)} }},
$$
ordered by subset inclusion,
and the family of observation languages $\observationsvar{N \in \notions^\literal{simple}}$ given by the family of grammars:

$$
\begin{array}{rcll}
  φ^N & \grammardef & \hmltrue{} & \\
      & \grammaror  & \hmlobs{α}φ^N & \\
      & \grammaror  & \hmland{i}{I}φ^N_i & \text{ if $\literal{(\land)} \in N$} \\
      & \grammaror  & \hmland{i}{I} \hmlneg \hmlobs{α_i}\hmltrue & \text{ if $\literal{(\neg)} \in N$} \\
      & \grammaror  & \hmlneg φ^N & \text{ if $\set{\literal{(\land)}, \literal{(\neg)} } = N$.}
\end{array}
$$

{{<noindent>}} Clearly, $N \subseteq M$ implies $\observationsvar{N} \subseteq \observationsvar{M}$ for $N, M \in \notions^\literal{simple}$.
We obtain the hierarchy of @fig-sample-hierarchy.

### The Strong Notions of Observability

We will use six dimensions to characterize the strong spectrum:

1. Formula modal depth of observations.
2. Formula nesting depth of conjunctions.
3. Maximal modal depth of deepest positive clauses in conjunctions.
4. Maximal modal depth of the other positive clauses in conjunctions.
5. Maximal modal depth of negative clauses in conjunctions.
6. Formula nesting depth of negations.

::: {#def-strong-spectrum}
#### Strong Spectrum

We define the strong notions of observability using vectors of extended naturals^[We write $\natsext$ for $\nats \cup \set{\infty}$.]
$$\notions^\literal{strong} ≔
\natsext^6,
$$
be ordered by pointwise comparison of vector components,
and the family of strong observation languages $\observationsvar{N \in \notions^\literal{strong}}^\literal{strong}$ given by the parameterized grammar starting from $φ^N$:{{<isb primrec Priced_HML formula_of_price>}}

$$
\begin{array}{rcll}
  φ^N & \grammardef & \hmltrue{} & \\
      & \grammaror  & \hmlobs{α}φ^{N - \unit{1}} & \\
      & \grammaror  & \hmlands\set{ψ^{N-\unit{2}},
        ψ^{(N-\unit{2}) \sqcap (\infty, \infty, N_4, \infty, \infty, \infty)},
        ψ^{(N-\unit{2}) \sqcap (\infty, \infty, N_4, \infty, \infty, \infty)}, \ldots} & \\
  ψ^N & \grammardef &
      \hmlobs{α}φ^{(N \sqcap (N_3, \infty, \infty, \infty, \infty, \infty)) - \unit{1}} & \\
      & \grammaror  &
      \hmlneg \hmlobs{α}φ^{(N \sqcap (N_5, \infty, \infty, \infty, \infty, \infty))- \unit{1} - \unit{6}} & \\
\end{array}
$$

{{<noindent>}} The productions only exist if the respective recursive invocations are defined on the domain of notions.
For instance, $φ^N \leadsto \hmlobs{α}φ^{N - \unit{1}}$ is no valid production for $N=(0,1,0,0,0,0)$ because $(-1,1,0,0,0,0) \notin \notions^\literal{strong}$.
:::

::: {#lem-spectrum-characterization}

The strong spectrum of @def-strong-spectrum contains the notions of behavioral equivalence we have discussed so far.

1. The observation language $\observationsvar{(\infty, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)}^\literal{strong}$ exactly matches the characterization of traces $\observations{T}$ from @def-sim-trace-logics and thus characterizes trace preorder.{{<isb theorem Priced_Spectrum lts.traces_priced_characterization>}}
2. The observation language $\observationsvar{(\infty, \infty, \infty, \infty, 0, 0)}^\literal{strong}$ exactly matches the characterization of simulation observations $\observations{S}$ from @def-sim-trace-logics and thus characterizes simulation.{{<isb theorem Priced_Spectrum lts.simulation_priced_characterization>}}
3. The observation language $\observationsvar{(\infty, \infty, \infty, \infty,  \infty, \infty)}^\literal{strong}$ matches $\hml$ in distinctiveness and thus characterizes bisimilarity.
4. The observation language $\observationsvar{(\infty, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)}^\literal{strong}$ exactly matches failure observations $\observations{F}$ of @def-failures-modal.
:::

::: {.proof}
The only non-trivial case is:

3. The difference is that $\observationsvar{(\infty, \infty, \infty, \infty,  \infty, \infty)}^\literal{strong}$ forces negations to appear in conjunctions. This does not affect expressive power as $\hmlneg \varphi \equiv \hmlands\set{\hmlneg \varphi}$.
TODO: Check, there have been changes to the grammar!

Hierarchy of common equivalences/preorders ordered by observability coordinates.
:::
:::

- TODO? Prove Characterizations?

There are a few standard questions that come to mind for people who are familiar with the various spectra of equivalences when seeing @fig-strong-ltbt-spectrum.
The following remarks try to address these points.

::: {#rem-other-strong-notions}
#### Selection of Notions

At the core, we treat the same notions as @glabbeek2001ltbtsiReport.
But we feature a slightly more modern selection.

Our spectrum additionally includes *impossible futures* (@vm2001impossible) and *revivals* (@roscoe2009revivalsHierarchy) as equivalences whose relevance has only been noted after the publication of @glabbeek2001ltbtsiReport.

On the other hand, we glimpse over completed trace, completed simulation, and possible worlds observations like @ke1999logicalProcessQuotients, who studied properties of “good” observation languages.
These notions would need a different HML grammar, featuring exhaustive conjunctions $\hmland{a}{\actions}\varphi_a$, where the $\varphi_a$ are deactivated actions for completed traces, and more complex trees for possible worlds.
<!-- While it could be provided for with additional operators, it would break the closure property of observation languages, without giving much in return.
For instance, for $\actions = \set{a,b}$, completed trace and completed simulation observations contain the observation $\hmlands\set{ \hmlneg\hmlobs{a}, \hmlneg\hmlobs{b} }$, but not its subformula $\hmlands\set{\hmlneg\hmlobs{a}}$.-->
:::

::: {#rem-ambiguous-coordinates}
#### Ambiguous Coordinates

For many of the logics in @fig-strong-ltbt-spectrum, there are multiple coordinates that characterize the same logic.
For instance, due to the second dimension (conjunctions) being set to $0$ for traces $\notionname{T}$, the higher dimensions do not matter and any coordinate $N = (\infty, 0, N_3, N_4, N_5, N_6)$ will lead to the same observation language $\observationsvar{N}^\literal{strong} = \observations{T}^\literal{strong}$.

Indeed, @fig-strong-ltbt-spectrum always selects the least coordinate to characterize a sublogic, which ensures that domination of coordinates in the figure and entailment between behavioral preorders coincide.
:::

::: {#rem-other-coordinates}
#### Other Coordinates

We have singled out a handful of coordinates.
Many other coordinates will still correspond to a distinct equivalence.
For instance, we could consider $N^{\notionname{2T}} = (2,0,0,0,0,0)$, preordering states that cannot be distinguished by traces up to a length of $2$.
But it is difficult to make a case for such a “notion of equivalence”---like most depth-bounded notions it fails to be a congruence.

Two kinds of depth-bounded families, however, are common in the literature:

- $k$-step bisimilarity: $(k,\infty,\infty,\infty,\infty,\infty)$ is a $k$-observation approximation of bisimilarity that sometimes appears in proofs.
- $k$-nested similarity: $(\infty,\infty,\infty,\infty,\infty,k-1)$ for $k>1$ defines a spectrum of modal quantifier alternation depth between similarity and bisimilarity.
:::

::: {#rem-infinities}
#### (In-)finitary Variants

One can introduce more dimensions to the spectrum with respect to the possibility of infinitary observations.
Our choice focuses on natural and most common versions of the equivalences, in particular:
similarity and bisimilarity with unbounded (infinitary) branching and trace-like notions with finitary depth.
Notions in @fig-strong-ltbt-spectrum correspond precisely to those without superscripts in the infinitary linear-time—branching-time spectrum of @glabbeek2001ltbtsiReport [Figure 9].
:::

### Non-Intersectionality

TODO: Incomparability: failure and sim but not bisim, even failure and sim, but not ready sim.

No-lattice of observations! $\observations{S} \cup \observations{F} \neq \observations{RS}$!

Leads to spectroscopy problem...

## Spectroscopy

### The Spectroscopy Problem

Introduced in @bjn2022decidingAllBehavioralEqs.

::: {#def-spectroscopy-problem}
#### Spectroscopy problem

In the context of a transition system $\system$ and a spectrum $(\notions, \leq, \observationsvar{N \in \notions})$, the *spectroscopy problem* asks:

- Input:  A pair of processes $p$ and $q$.
- Output: Set of notions $\notions_{p,q} \subseteq \notions$, such that $p \bpreordvar{\observationsvar{N}} q$ for each $N \in \notions_{p,q}$.
:::

Technically, we will usually aim to compute the *Pareto front* of minimal notions that do not hold, $\Min(\notions \setminus \notions_{p,q})$.
The Pareto front serves as a unique representation, from which $\notions_{p,q}$ can be constructed as upset-complement $\notions \setminus \upset \Min(\notions \setminus \notions_{p,q})$
(where ${\upset\! B} := \set{b \mid \exists b' \in B \ldotp b' \leq b}$ for $B$ subset of some partially-ordered set).

All spectra we are concerned with are well-quasi ordered, which means that each $\Min(\notions \setminus \notions_{p,q})$ must be finite in size [@kruskal1972wqo], and thus “more handy” than the full sets $\notions_{p,q}$ or $\notions \setminus \notions_{p,q}$.

::: {#exm-spectroscopy-front}
For the “trolled philosophers” of @exm-bisim-sim, we have determined that the systems are simulation-preordered, but not bisimilar, that is, $\literal{Q} \bpreord{S} \literal{Q'}$, but $\literal{Q} \nbpreord{B} \literal{Q'}$.
The first fact implies $\literal{Q} \bpreord{T} \literal{Q'}$.

But what about other notions from the strong spectrum of Subsection -@sec-full-spectrum?
Besides similarity, there might well be incomparable or finer notions that too preorder $\literal{Q}$ to $\literal{Q'}$!

The solution to the spectroscopy problem on $\literal{Q}$ and $\literal{Q'}$ is $\notions^{\literal{strong}}_{\literal{Q}, \literal{Q'}} = \set{N \in \notions^\literal{strong} \mid N \nleq (2,2,0,0,2,2)}$.
A minimal formula to distinguish $\literal{Q}$ from $\literal{Q'}$ with this coordinate would be $\hmlands\set{\hmlneg\hmlobs{\tau}\hmlands\set{\hmlneg\hmlobs{\literal{a}}\hmltrue}}$.
(The following chapters will reveal how to reliably arrive at this knowledge, in particular, the minimality.)

Because the coordinate of $2$-nested simulation, $\notionname{2S} = (\infty,\infty,\infty,\infty,\infty,1)$ is not less or equal to $(2,2,0,0,2,2)$, we arrive at $\literal{Q} \bpreord{2S} \literal{Q'}$, which implies *all* preorders of @fig-strong-ltbt-spectrum except for bisimilarity.

All preorders below the red mark hold in @exm-spectroscopy-front.
:::

Note that we have expressed $\notions^{\literal{strong}}_{\literal{Q}, \literal{Q'}}$ through a negation (“$\dots \nleq (2,2,0,0,2,2)$”).
The reason is that a positive description is usually unwieldy.
In this (comparably easy) case, we could for example list the half-spaces below the cheapest distinction, and this would read:
$\notions^{\literal{strong}}_{\literal{Q}, \literal{Q'}} =
(\set{0,1} \times \natsext^5) \cup
(\natsext \times \set{0,1} \times \natsext^4) \cup
(\natsext^4 \times \set{0,1} \times \natsext) \cup
(\natsext^5 \times \set{0,1})$.

### Spectroscopy as Abstract Interpretation

::: {#def-observations}
#### Observations

On a transition system, the possible observations of a state, $\semanticsobs{\cdot} \colon \states \to \powerset{\hml}$, are defined as:

$$\semanticsobs{p} ≔ \set{φ ∈ \hml \mid p ∈ \semantics{φ}}.$$
:::

::: {#def-obs-difference}
#### Observable Difference

The *difference* between $p$ and $q$ is defined as:
$$\difference{p}{q} ≔ \semanticsobs{p} \setminus \semanticsobs{q}.$$
:::

::: {#prp-behavioraleq}
### Behavioral preorder and equivalence

Rephrasing @def-distinctions, two states are preordered with respect to a sublogic $\observationsvar{} ⊆ \hml$
$$p \bpreordvar{\observationsvar{}} q ⟺ \difference{p}{q} \cap \observationsvar{} = \varnothing.$$
:::

Distinction formulation:

> What are the notions $N$ such that $\difference{p}{q} \cap \observationsvar{N} \neq \varnothing$?


### Complexities {#sec-equivalence-complexities}

What complexities to expect when deciding spectroscopy problems?
Details depend, of course, on the specific spectrum and flavor of Hennessy–Milner logic we are concerned with.
Still, solving the spectroscopy problem cannot be easier than solving the covered individual equivalence problems.

To get a first idea, let us examine the complexities of common equivalence checking problems.
The rule of thumb is that trace-like equivalences are $\complexityname{PSPACE}$-complete and bisimilarities are $\complexityname{P}$-complete [@hs1996complexityEquivalences;@bgs1992bisimPComplete].

Bisimilarity finds itself in a *valley* of tractability,
if we look at a cross section through the equivalence spectrum as in @fig-complexity-slope.
The best known bisimilarity algorithms for finite-state transition systems take $\bigo{\relsize{\step{}} \log \relsize{S}}$ time [usually deriving from @paigetarjan1987partitionrefinement].

Bisimilarity's complexity valley.

For coarser simulation-like equivalences, the best known algorithms need $\bigo{\relsize{\step{}} \relsize{S}}$ time [@rt2010efficientSimulation].^[Or $\bigo{\relsize{\step{}} \relsize{\relqotient{S}{\beq{S}}}}$ to name the bound as @rt2010efficientSimulation present it.]

The finer graph-isomorphism equivalence again is harder with the best known solution [@babai2016graphIsomorphismQuasiPoly] in quasi-polynomial time $2^{\bigo{(\log n)^3}}$.

There however are no strict hardness results at this level of granularity.
So, better time complexities for graph isomorphism, bisimilarity, and similarity are conceivable (albeit improbable).
@gmv2023lowerboundsBisimPartitionRefinement show that at least partition-refinement algorithms for bisimilarity cannot do better than $\bigo{\relsize{\step{}} \log \relsize{S}}$.

The trivial equivalences at the end of the cross section, identity $\notionname{ID}$ and universal equivalence $\notionname{U}$, can be solved directly.
Enabledness equivalence $\notionname{E}$ can as well be computed quite quickly by just comparing outgoing transitions.

In this thesis, we solve the spectroscopy problem for the strong and weak spectrum.
So, we must be at least as complex as the equivalences between bisimilarity and universal equivalence, boxed in @fig-complexity-slope.
Consequently, the spectroscopy problem for the standard equivalence spectra is $\complexityname{PSPACE}$-hard.

## Discussion

- Deviates slightly from @bisping2023equivalenceEnergyGames:
  - Parameterized grammar instead of expressiveness price function
  - Count $\hmltrue$ as zero-priced instead of one conjunction.
  - Force observations in clauses
- Spectroscopy problem
  - complexity must be at least $\complexityname{PSPACE}$ for whole strong spectrum
  - polynomial part of spectrum (around bisimilarity and similarity) might be possible to capture in polynomial time (-> forward pointer to bisim energy game)

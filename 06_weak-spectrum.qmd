For practical problems, the equivalences we have discussed so far usually are *too strong*.
They notice where in a process the *internal action* $\tau$ happens, that is: 
$$\literal{a} \nbeq{} \ccsprefix{\tau} \literal{a} \nbeq{} \ccsprefix{\tau} \ccsprefix{\tau} \literal{a} \nbeq{} \ccsprefix{\tau}\ccsprefix{\literal{a}} \tau  \nbeq{} \ccsprefix{\literal{a}} \tau$$

For real-world models, we want equivalences to disregard such kinds of internal behavior as “silent”  when comparing processes, such that:

$$\literal{a} \beq{} \ccsprefix{\tau} \literal{a} \beq{} \ccsprefix{\tau} \ccsprefix{\tau} \literal{a} \beq{} \ccsprefix{\tau}\ccsprefix{\literal{a}} \tau  \beq{} \ccsprefix{\literal{a}} \tau$$

Equivalences with this feature are called *weak*, alluding to the fact that they are less distinctive than the “strong” equivalences that treat $\tau$ like any other action.

The basic principle is that weak equivalences should maintain that some internal behavior happening before or after a visible action does not make a difference from the point of view of an observer.
But this idea leads into a lot of fine points.

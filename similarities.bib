These bisimulation relations preserve CSP semantics, as well as the operational semantics of programs in other languages with operational semantics described by such GLTSs and relying only on observational equivalence. They can therefore be used to combat the space explosion problem faced in explicit model checking for such languages. We concentrate on algorithms which work efficiently when implemented rather than on ones which have low asymptotic growth.},

This equivalence belongs to the bisimulation family of semantic equivalences, in the sense that on transition systems without internal actions it coincides with strong bisimilarity. Nevertheless, enough of the equational laws of CSP remain to obtain a complete axiomatisation for closed, recursion-free terms.",

We try to answer this question by describing two general methods that can be used to construct direct one-to-one polynomial-time reductions from bisimulation equivalence to simulation preorder (and simulation equivalence). These methods can be applied to many classes of finitely generated transition systems, provided that they satisfy certain abstractly formulated conditions. Roughly speaking, our first method works for all classes of systems that can test for `non-enabledness' of actions, while our second method works for all classes of systems that are closed under synchronization.},

  abstract    = {Discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains as well as interactive
	Markov chains are widely used model classes for the analysis of
	stochastic systems. A fundamental problem thereby is the number of
	states, which in general grows exponentially in the size of the
	corresponding high-level model.\par
	In this work we develop two methods to cope with this problem. The
	first one consists of the computation of a system with a minimal
	number of states and the same observable behavior as the original
	system. This allows us to carry out any analysis with well-known
	algorithms on the minimal system. Depending on the definition of
	observability we obtain different minimal systems. Our algorithm is
	able to handle a large number system types and minimization criteria
	which are considered practically relevant in the literature. Our
	method works with symbolic data structures and dedicated operations
	thereon whose runtime only depends on the size of the representation
	instead of the size of the represented system. The size of the
	symbolic representation of many real-world systems, however, is
	smaller by orders of magnitudes than the system itself. Experimental
	results prove the efficiency of our algorithm.\par
	The other method to handle large state spaces is to develop algorithms
	which are directly applicable to large systems. For the refutation of
	safety properties in digital circuits a method called Bounded Model
	Checking has been developed, which is nowadays successfully applied
	also in industry. We show how Bounded Model Checking can be adapted to
	compute counterexamples for discrete-time Markov chains if a given
	safety property is violated. By a number of optimization technique we
	can reduce not only the runtime but also the size of the
	counterexamples. The result is a method which is able to handle
	significantly larger systems than the previously available algorithms.},

Experimentelle Ergebnisse belegen die Effzienz unseres Verfahrens.\par Die andere Methode, mit gro{\ss}en Zustandsr{\"a}umen umzugehen, ist, symbolische Algorithmen zur Analyse zu entwickeln, die direkt auf gro{\ss}e Systemen anwendbar sind. F{\"u}r die Fehlersuche in Schaltkreisen wird eine Methode namens Bounded Model Checking verwendet, die inzwischen auch industriell sehr erfolgreich eingesetzt wird. Wir zeigen, wie Bounded Model Checking zur Berechnung von Gegenbeispielen f{\"u}r Markow-Ketten eingesetzt werden kann, wenn diese eine vorgegebene Sicherheitseigenschaft verletzen. Durch eine Reihe von Optimierungen gelingt es uns, sowohl die Laufzeit zu reduzieren als auch die Gr{\"o}{\ss}e der Gegenbeispiele zu verringern. Das Resultat ist ein Verfahren, das deutlich gr{\"o}{\ss}ere Systeme als die bisher verf{\"u}gbaren expliziten Methoden handhaben kann.},

In this paper we describe the operation of FDR3 at a high level and then give a detailed description of several of its more important innovations. This includes the new multi-core refinement-checking algorithm that is able to achieve a near linear speed up as the number of cores increase. Further, we describe the new algorithm that FDR3 uses to construct its internal representation of CSP processes---this algorithm is more efficient than FDR2's, and is able to compile a large class of CSP processes to more efficient internal representations. We also present experimental results that compare FDR3 to related tools, which show it is unique (as far as we know) in being able to scale beyond the bounds of main memory.},

In this paper we work in the general setting of coalgebra and focus on generic algorithms for computing the winning strategies of both players in a bisimulation game. The winning strategy of the spoiler (if it exists) is then transformed into a modal formula that distinguishes the given non-bisimilar states. The modalities required for the formula are also synthesized on-the-fly, and we present a recipe for re-coding the formula with different modalities, given by a separating set of predicate liftings. Both the game and the generation of the distinguishing formulas have been implemented in a tool called T-Beg.",

This issue has been traditionally addressed by developing, for a specific process semantics, a syntactic format for operational semantics specifications. We suggest a novel, orthogonal approach, which focuses on a specific process operator and determines a class of congruence relations for this operator. To this end, we impose syntactic restrictions on Hennessy–Milner logic, so that a process semantics whose modal characterization satisfies those criteria is guaranteed to be a congruence with respect to the operator in question. We investigate alternative composition, action prefix, projection, encapsulation, renaming, and parallel composition with communication, in the context of both concrete and weak process semantics.",

abstract = {Process equivalences are formal methods that relate programs and systems which, informally, behave in the same way. Since there is no unique notion of what it means for two dynamic systems to display the same behaviour there are a multitude of formal process equivalences, ranging from bisimulation to trace equivalence, categorised in the linear-time branching-time spectrum. We present a logical framework based on an expressive modal fixpoint logic which is capable of defining many process equivalence relations: for each such equivalence there is a fixed formula which is satisfied by a pair of processes if and only if they are equivalent with respect to this relation. We explain how to do model checking for this logic in EXPTIME. This allows model checking technology to be used for process equivalence checking. We introduce two fragments of the logic for which it is possible to do model-checking in PTIME and PSPACE respectively, and show that the formulas that define the process equivalences we consider are in one of these fragments. This yields a generic proof technique for establishing the complexities of these process equivalences. Finally, we show how partial evaluation can be used to obtain decision procedures for process equivalences from the generic model checking scheme.}

These are games played on finite weighted automata and concern the existence of infinite runs subject to boundary constraints on the accumulated weight, allowing e.g only for behaviours where a resource is always available (nonnegative accumulated weight), yet does not exceed a given maximum capacity. We extend energy games to a multiweighted and parameterized setting, allowing us to model systems with multiple quantitative aspects. We present reductions between Petri nets and multiweighted automata and among different types of multiweighted automata and identify new complexity and (un)decidability results for both one- and two-player games. We also investigate the tractability of an extension of multiweighted energy games in the setting of timed automata.",

For sequences s and t, we define s ⩽ t if some subsequence of t majorizes s term by term. Then the space of all finite sequences over a well-partially-ordered set is itself well-partially-ordered.}

abstract = {In mean-payoff games, the objective of the protagonist is to ensure that the limit average of an infinite sequence of numeric weights is nonnegative. In energy games, the objective is to ensure that the running sum of weights is always nonnegative. Multi-mean-payoff and multi-energy games replace individual weights by tuples, and the limit average (resp., running sum) of each coordinate must be (resp., remain) nonnegative. We prove finite-memory determinacy of multi-energy games and show inter-reducibility of multi-mean-payoff and multi-energy games for finite-memory strategies. We improve the computational complexity for solving both classes with finite-memory strategies: we prove coNP-completeness improving the previous known EXPSPACE bound. For memoryless strategies, we show that deciding the existence of a winning strategy for the protagonist is NP-complete. We present the first solution of multi-mean-payoff games with infinite-memory strategies: we show that mean-payoff-sup objectives can be decided in NP∩coNP, whereas mean-payoff-inf objectives are coNP-complete.}

abstract="We consider parity games on infinite graphs where configurations are represented by control-states and integer vectors. This framework subsumes two classic game problems: parity games on vector addition systems with states (vass) and multidimensional energy parity games. We show that the multidimensional energy parity game problem is inter-reducible with a subclass of single-sided parity games on vass where just one player can modify the integer counters and the opponent can only change control-states. Our main result is that the minimal elements of the upward-closed winning set of these single-sided parity games on vass are computable. This implies that the Pareto frontier of the minimal initial credit needed to win multidimensional energy parity games is also computable, solving an open question from the literature. Moreover, our main result implies the decidability of weak simulation preorder/equivalence between finite-state systems and vass, and the decidability of model checking vass with a large fragment of the modal $\mu$-calculus.",

One experience from our work is that a large number of interesting verification methods can be formulated as combinations of a small number of primitive algorithms.

Based on a previous work of Gurevich and Harrington and on subsequent improvements of McNaughton we propose a unique framework that allows to reestablish and to improve various results concerning memoryless strategies due to Emerson and Jutla, Mostowski, Klarlund.}

Thus we extend the classic linear-time–branching-time spectrum to a quantitative setting, parametrized by trace distance. We also prove a general transfer principle which allows us to transfer counterexamples from the qualitative to the quantitative setting, showing that all system distances are mutually topologically inequivalent.}
